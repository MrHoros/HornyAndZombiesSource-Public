.. [#f1] plus a component visualizer for debug and level design
.. [#f2] we need it to implement default grid-based movement
.. [#f3] if you have custom UGridNavigationAgent, add it to Component's 'AgentClasses'
.. [#f4] if you have custom class, set it properly in spawn parameter
.. [#f5] Default is UGridDecalPainter which using decal component to rendering grid
